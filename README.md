# Unit Converter with Streamlit and Gemini

Unit Converter is a Python-based web application built using Streamlit that allows users to easily convert different units such as temperature, length, and weight. The app also integrates the Gemini chatbot, which provides interactive and intelligent responses to user queries, making the app more user-friendly and dynamic. The chatbot can answer questions related to unit conversion, help with conversions, and engage in general conversation.

## Chatbot Integration with Gemini 3.5

This project also integrates the Gemini 3.5 chatbot, which provides an intelligent conversational experience for users. The chatbot can:

- Answer general questions.
- Assist users with unit conversions.
- Engage in casual conversation to enhance user interaction.

The chatbot is powered by the Gemini 3.5 model and interacts through a user-friendly chat interface built into the Streamlit app.

### How It Works:
- When users open the app, they can use the chat feature to ask questions or receive help with unit conversions.
- The chatbot responds intelligently based on the queries and provides the appropriate assistance.
